# My React Learning Journey

Welcome to my React learning journey! In this repository, I'm documenting my progress and code as I learn React episode by episode.

## Project Overview

This project is my hands-on learning experience with React. I'm breaking down my learning into episodes, with each episode dedicated to a specific aspect of React development. The goal is to build a strong foundation in React and showcase my progress along the way.

## Who can benefit from this repo?
This repository will be useful for all the developers, who has basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript and taken up [NamasteDev]() course for react and want to refer the codebase which was discussed during the course and can also contribute to update the documentation and furthermore add some additional cool features to the current projects. 

## Tools Required:
You need to install these two application on your machine before you start the course and also to run the app.
- VS Code (Editor) - [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Chrome (Browser) - [Download](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- node.js - [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)
- git - [Download](https://git-scm.com/)

## Tech Stack you will learn in this course:
As you go forward in the course, you will find all the given tech stack coming your way and at the end of the course you will end learning about all these teck stacks. So buckle up, its going to be a roller-coaster.
- React V18 (UI Library)
- Tailwind (CSS Library)
- Redux Toolkit (State Management System)
- React Router DOM (Page Navigation)
- Parcel (Bundler)
- Babel (Transpiler)
- Jest (Unit Testing)
- React Testing Library (React Component Testing)

## Steps to run the app
- Step 1: Open your VS Code editor's terminal.
- Step 2: Clone the repo by running the command below on your VS Code terminal.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mghadage/react-course.git
cd react-course
```
- Step 2: Now, you are at the root of the folder. Choose which episode's app you want to run.
- Step 3: Move into the folder. Lets say I want to run the app from `Episode-03-laying-the-foundation`
```sh
cd Episode-03-laying-the-foundation
```
- Step 4: If that folder contains a `package.json` file. Run the below command to install the dependency packages.
```sh
npm install
```
- Step 5: Run the app
```sh
npm start
```
- Step 6: Open the browser, and paste this link [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/).
- Step 7: You will be able to see the app running.

# My React Learning Journey

Welcome to my React learning journey! In this repository, I'm documenting my progress and code as I learn React episode by episode.

## Project Overview

This project is my hands-on learning experience with React. I'm breaking down my learning into episodes, with each episode dedicated to a specific aspect of React development. The goal is to build a strong foundation in React and showcase my progress along the way.

## Episodes

- [Episode 1: Inception](./episode1)
- [Episode 2: Igning our app](./episode2)
- [Episode 3: Laying the foundation](./episode3)
- coming soon..

Each episode folder contains the code and documentation related to that specific topic. Feel free to explore and learn alongside me!

## Resources

I'm using various resources to aid my learning, including:

- Official React documentation: [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/)
- Online tutorials and articles
- Community forums and discussions

## Connect with Me

I'm open to feedback, questions, and suggestions. If you'd like to connect, share insights, or provide feedback on my learning journey, you can reach me on [GitHub](https://github.com/mghadage) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mg-mahesh-ghadage/).

Happy learning and coding!
